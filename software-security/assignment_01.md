1. Describe the difference between safety and security. (10)

Safety is about protecting the system from accidents, while security is about protecting the system from malicious attacks. It's important to take notice of all safety problems but isn't nesscessary to solve all them. Most of the time its just an economic descision to prevent from an hazard or take the risk. Secutity issues might be harder to solve, because in general they don't have to be visible at all. This can include spyware or other malware that is installed on a system without the user's knowledge.


2. Describe three situations where social engineering might lead to computer security issues. (20)

a. Phishing: Phishing is a type of social engineering attack often used to steal user data, including login credentials and credit card numbers. It occurs when an attacker, masquerading as a trusted entity, dupes a victim into opening an email, instant message, or text message. The recipient is then tricked into clicking a malicious link, which can lead to a dupe of the login page for administration of some software. Sensitive information can be captured and used by the attacker on the original site to gain access to the system.

b. Shoulder Surfing: Shoulder surfing is a type of social engineering attack where the attacker tries to obtain information such as passwords, PINs, and other sensitive information by looking over the victim's shoulder. This can be done in person or by using a camera or other recording device. The attacker can then use this information to gain unauthorized access to the victim's accounts or systems.

c. Baiting: Baiting is a type of social engineering attack where the attacker offers something of value. This example is a real one I expirienced and needs a bit more fantasy than the classical lost USB-Stick in a parking lot.

An engeneering office (XXX) needed a new cleaning service because the old contracts have expired. XXX started a call for tenders to find a new cleaning service. The cleaning service "YYY" (with employes of a foreign country, wich is not untypiclal) was the clear winner with the lowest prices and started to clean the office. After a few weeks, the security inteligence of XXX found their own unfinished products on black market. An investigation showed that the cleaning service "YYY" had copied the data from the computers in the office and sold it to the black market. The cleaning service "YYY" was a fake company that was created by a group of professional engeneers who had the idea to steal the data from the office. The cleaning service "YYY" was a bait to get the data from the office.

3. Describe the difference between symptomatic and curative IT security measures. Give examples. (25)

Symptomatic IT security measures are designed to address the symptoms of a security problem, rather than the root cause. These measures are often reactive and focus on mitigating the effects of an attack or breach, rather than preventing it from happening in the first place. Examples of symptomatic IT security measures include (antivirus software), intrusion detection systems, and incident response plans.

Curative IT security measures, on the other hand, are designed to address the root cause of a security problem and prevent it from happening in the first place. These measures are often proactive and focus on identifying and fixing vulnerabilities before they can be exploited. Examples of curative IT security measures include regular security assessments, patch management, and security awareness training.

4. How could IT security profit from IT forensics? (10)

IT security can profit from IT forensics by providing valuable information about security incidents and breaches. IT forensics can help identify the root cause of a security problem, determine the extent of the damage, and provide evidence that can be used to prosecute attackers. By using IT forensics, organizations can better understand how attacks occur and take steps to prevent them from happening in the future. IT forensics can also help organizations recover from security incidents more quickly and effectively by providing a clear roadmap for remediation.

5. What side effects could IT security issues in IoT and embedded systems have? (20)

IoT systems are often used at home or in industrial environments. If these systems are not secure, they can be easily hacked and used to launch attacks on other systems. For example, an attacker could use a compromised IoT device to launch a DDoS attack on a website or network. This could lead to downtime, data loss, and other negative consequences for the victim. The special thing about those attacs is that the damage is done to a victom, who is not the owner of the IoT device. The owner of the IoT device might not even notice that his device is used for an attack.

6. How does IT security affect "CyberWarfare"? (15)

IT security plays a critical role in cyber warfare by protecting critical infrastructure, government systems, and military networks from cyber attacks. Cyber warfare is the use of digital attacks to disrupt, damage, or destroy computer systems or networks. These attacks can be used to steal sensitive information, disrupt operations, or cause physical damage. By implementing strong IT security measures, organizations can defend against cyber attacks and protect their systems from being compromised. IT security can also help organizations detect and respond to cyber attacks more quickly and effectively, reducing the impact of these attacks on their operations.
