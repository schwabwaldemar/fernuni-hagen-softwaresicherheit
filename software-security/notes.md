### 1.1. What is Safety?



#### Exercise 1

Assume you were running a small IT consultancy as a freelancer, you'd be communicating with your customers using both your mobile phone and a pseudo-landline, which in fact is voice-over-IP. Obviously there is email communication as well, with some colleagues you are using several instant messengers and e.g. Skype. Both for your own record but also to avoid legal issues you should be keeping a record of your communication.

Most of your work is either done in your (home) office via these communication means, some requires you to travel to the costumer.

What safety risks would you identify? How would you try to overcome them?

Assuming you would not rely on Webservices only, you would have some kind of backup. Simplest way is a local copy of your E-Mails and your Skype Chats. Loosing your Backup by an event of theft or fire would be a risk.
