### Please describe the differences between forensic investigation and incident response. (15)
In cybersecurity, forensic investigation and incident response serve essential but distinct functions when dealing with security incidents. Forensic investigation is primarily concerned with uncovering the facts about a cybersecurity incident. It aims to determine how an incident occurred, identify the perpetrators, and gather evidence for legal proceedings. The focus is on reconstructing the sequence of events in detail to establish an accurate timeline and understand the intricacies of the incident.

#### Main Goals
In contrast, the main goal of incident response is to quickly contain and mitigate the impact of a cybersecurity incident. This process is about rapid identification, containment, and eradication of threats, followed by restoration of systems to their normal states. Incident response prioritizes reducing damage, shortening recovery times, and preventing future incidents through immediate action.

#### Aproach
The approach to each discipline also differs significantly. Forensic investigation involves a methodical process of evidence identification, data preservation, artifact analysis, and documentation to maintain data integrity and admissibility in court.

On the other hand, incident response follows a structured protocol outlined in an Incident Response Plan (IRP), which includes preparation, detection, analysis, containment, eradication, and recovery. Tools used in this realm are designed for speed and efficiency, including SIEM systems, IDS, and automated remediation tools. The techniques focus on real-time monitoring and anomaly detection to quickly address threats.

#### Documentation
Both fields require thorough documentation, though their purposes diverge. Forensic investigation documentation must be precise and is structured for use in legal contexts, often needed to be understood by non-technical stakeholders such as law enforcement or legal teams. Conversely, documentation in incident response records the incident’s timeline and impact to inform internal and sometimes regulatory stakeholders, focusing on resolution and prevention strategies.


Ultimately, the outcomes of each process also reflect their differing objectives. Forensic investigations aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the incident, support potential legal actions against the perpetrators, and inform broader security policies. In contrast, incident response seeks to minimize business disruption and make strategic recommendations to bolster defenses against future attacks.
